                With the exception of a rare few, video games are notoriously ephemeral things.
                Far more than in film, TV, or music, even the greatest achievements in games are all but guaranteed rapid obsolescence. 
                Beholden to the ever-evolving technology that powers them, it's hard for any game to withstand the test of a single console cycle, 
                let alone sustain large, active player communities for a double-digit number of years. For story-focused single-player adventures that don't live online, 
                the feat is practically unheard of.
                But one iconic title celebrating its 10-year anniversary in 2021 flies in the face of those norms, 
                like a legendary dragon soaring through the sky with the roar of a creature that never truly dies: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

                Below is a well-known soundtrack from the popular game Skyrim.

                In 2011, Skyrim(Opens in a new window) instantly became the most played game of the year(Opens in a new window), 
                despite existing for only three of those 12 months. In 2021, the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360-era title (or rather, its countless re-releases) 
                still maintains millions of monthly players(Opens in a new window) according to Bethesda director Todd Howard, 
                who seems pretty baffled himself by its unrelenting endurance. 
                Aside from just outlasting the relevance of the Elder Scrolls series 2014 online multiplayer game(Opens in a new window), Skyrim still outshines most of the newest, 
                most hyped fantasy role-playing games that boast bigger, more polished and technologically advanced open worlds.

                When I took the Anniversary Edition for a spin, 
                I was stunned to realize just how much playing Skyrim today feels as fresh as it did the first time the title screen's bombastic Viking choir ever beckoned me to adventure.
                Though a thriving community of modders continue to fill the world's expansiveness with new possibilities by regularly sharing their custom add-ons through Bethesda's Creation Club(Opens in a new window), 
                Skyrim's timelessness goes beyond its greatness as a game. 
                Its release received the kind of zeitgeist-y spotlight in which video games — let alone nerdy high fantasy ones — ever get to bask. 
                Even now, Skyrim still thrives as a cultural phenomenon, too, through meme formats that have become mainstays of internet humor.
