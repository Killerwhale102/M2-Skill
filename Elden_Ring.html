                For 13 years, FromSoftware has essentially been making the same game: The six titles that comprise the
                Soulsbourne series,
                a series of third-person fantasy role playing games. Each has its strengths. Demon's Souls,
                the first, was the wildest in its invention; Dark Souls featured the most intricate world. Dark Souls 2,
                often maligned,
                deserves rehabilitation for its dizzying array of character builds. Dark Souls 3 had the finest, most
                monstrous bosses. Sekiro, released in 2019,
                was the furthest departure, but introduced stealth and clean, rhythmic combat. Until now, Bloodborne,
                released in 2015,
                had represented the finest combination of the other game's sensibilities and mechanics.

                Elden Ring, released on Friday, builds on the strengths of its predecessors in ways that will thrill
                longtime fans and convert new players.
                This is a game that could not have been made on the first attempt. It's the culmination of everything
                the studio has been working toward,
                the best game they have ever made, and, in my opinion, one of the best games of all time.
                At the game's opening, you craft a hideous-looking character—in keeping with the series tradition—and
                escape a small cave, learning swordplay,
                shield-blocking, and magic along the way. Debouching into a glorious vista of green hills and golden
                trees,
                a masked man accuses you of being “maidenless” and suggests you “go and die and in a ditch.” As you walk
                down the stone steps toward the forest,
                an 8-foot golden knight on horseback immediately brutalizes you.

                Your journey into one of the great game worlds—a blend of European medieval architecture and Japanese
                folklore,
                heavily influenced by the manga Berserk, by Kentaro Miura, and for this entry, suggestions by George R.
                R. Martin—has begun.
                Previous entries were deceptively linear: Each area, be it a forest, castle, or swamp, threaded together
                via narrow paths that propelled the player forward,
                or occasionally back on themselves. Like Breath of the Wild did for the Legend of Zelda franchise, Elden
                Ring reimagines Dark Souls in an open world.
                I replayed Dark Souls 3 in preparation for this review,
                and while it retained much of its charm, after 100 hours its linearity starts to chafe; I've spent 50
                hours exploring The Lands Between,
                and I still have no sense of their circumference.
